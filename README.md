# google-play-store-jupyter-notebook

A Jupyter Notebook which looks at data for apps in Google's Play Store.

Contains exmaples of:
* Removing duplicates and NaN values.
* Plotly charts (pie, donut, bar, grouped bar, scatter, and box plots).
* Examples of updating chart layouts.
* Extracting data from a column which contains multiple values, then stacking them.

## NOTE: 

Graphs created using plotly do not render on GitHub. I found some code that will show plotly graphs through [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/),
but then the graphs won't render locally. I might create another branch on this repo, so that the notebook in the alternate branch can be used
to see the plotly graphs through NBViewer.
