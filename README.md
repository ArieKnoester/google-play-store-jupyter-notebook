# google-play-store-jupyter-notebook

A Jupyter Notebook which looks at data for apps in Google's Play Store.

Contains exmaples of:
* Removing duplicates and NaN values.
* Plotly charts (pie, donut, bar, grouped bar, scatter, and box plots).
* Examples of updating chart layouts.
* Extracting data from a column which contains multiple values, then stacking them.

## NOTE: 

Graphs created using plotly do not render on GitHub. They can be viewed by copying the URL for the .ipynb file in this repo and using [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/)
or by using [this link](https://nbviewer.org/github/ArieKnoester/google-play-store-jupyter-notebook/blob/main/Google_Play_Store_App_Analytics.ipynb).
Plotly graphs should render and hover data should work.
