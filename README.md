# google-play-store-jupyter-notebook

Work in progress

A Jupyter Notebook which looks at data for apps in Google's Play Store.

## NOTE: 

Graphs created using plotly do not render on GitHub. I found some code that will show plotly graphs through [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/),
but then the graphs won't render locally. I might create another branch on this repo, so that the notebook in the alternate branch can be used
to see the plotly graphs through NBViewer.
